#
#Generic Kickstart template for Ubuntu
#Platform: x86 and x86-64
#
# Customized for Server 14.04 minimal vm install
#
# Usage:
# - Look through config for any changes you want to do. You may want to change
#   the initial admin user. Currently username is ubuntu and password is
#   ChangeMe. Also may want to change the list of installed packages. Tried to
#   keep it as minimal as possible.
# - Place this somewhere that the vm will be able to see. Web server on LAN
#   would work best.
# - OPTIONAL: If you are going to make a bunch of these then may want to setup
#   a local apt proxy. Install apt-cacher-ng on some system and edit the line
#   below.
# - Create a vm with 8gb drive. You can make a larger one but should have 8
#   minimum. Also tip for people setting up in vmware the kernel has support
#   for VMXNET3 compiled in so you can use it for initial install.
# - Boot up from iso.
# - Hit F4 and choose 'Install a minimal virtual machine'
#   - This is required even though we set it below.
# - Press F6 and hit escape so you edit the boot line. Add the following to the
#   end before the --. For example if you did include the '--' the end of boot
#   line would be:
#
#       ks=http://your-server.example.com/ks-minimalvm.cfg --
#
# - That's it! It will grab an ip via dhcp on eth0 and setup the system.
#
# Tweaks:
# - Some people would argue I made too many partitions. Feel free to adjust if
#   you set things up differently. I highly recommend at least a /var and /home
#   to make sure neither of those filling up will halt the whole system.
# - After partitioning with an 8gb volume you'll have about 1gb left in lvm to
#   either expand one of the existing vms or to add a new partition. Again my
#   suggesting is a second drive for /opt and/or /srv. If you mess up the OS
#   you can unmount the second drive and mount it on a new vm that has the OS
#   rebuilt on it.
# - The post script adds the noatime,nodev to options. In some circumstances
#   you need the access time (most common use is the mail spool to know when
#   you last checked for mail). In those instances you may want to change it to
#   relatime for home and/or var.
# - The post script will set the default umask from 022 to 027. This means
#   files created will not be world-readable. This is good to have for security
#   but if you don't want that comment it out.
